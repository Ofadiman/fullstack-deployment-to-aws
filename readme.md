# Fullstack deployment to AWS

The project shows how to deploy a full stack application on Amazon Web Services using CI/CD tools. Frontend is an SPA application written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), backend is a typical Node.js server written in [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). A popular open-source relational database [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) was also used in the project. Continuous integration and deployment processes are covered by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) service.

Full guide on how to deploy the project on AWS can be found in the [documentation](documentation) folder. I recommend starting from [the first part](/documentation/01-project-initialization.md), which introduces you to how to start a project, how to configure git, and what tools you'll need for project development.
